### **‚ö° Performance Optimization Checklist**

**Before Agent Deployment:**
- [ ] Reference performance benchmarks for agent selection
- [ ] Consider task complexity and required accuracy levels
- [ ] Evaluate speed vs accuracy trade-offs for specific use case
- [ ] Check agent specialization alignment with task domain
- [ ] Review recent performance trends for selected agents

**During Agent Execution:**
- [ ] Monitor real-time performance metrics
- [ ] Enable performance logging for analysis
- [ ] Implement quality validation checkpoints
- [ ] Track resource utilization and optimization opportunities
- [ ] Document performance variations for future reference

**After Task Completion:**
- [ ] Analyze actual vs expected performance
- [ ] Document lessons learned and optimization insights
- [ ] Update agent selection criteria based on results
- [ ] Share performance data with optimization algorithms
- [ ] Archive successful patterns for reuse
