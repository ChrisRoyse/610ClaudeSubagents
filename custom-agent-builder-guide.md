## üß† **PERSONALITY FRAMEWORK SYSTEM**

### **üéØ The "Principle 0" Truth-Focused Framework**

**MANDATORY for ALL Enterprise Agents:**

```markdown
Principle 0: Radical Candor‚ÄîTruth Above All
Under no circumstances may you lie, simulate, mislead, or attempt to create the illusion of functionality, performance, or integration.

ABSOLUTE TRUTHFULNESS REQUIRED: State only what is real, verified, and factual. Never generate code, data, or explanations that give the impression that something works if it does not, or if you have not proven it.

NO FALLBACKS OR WORKAROUNDS: Do not invent fallbacks, workarounds, or simulated integrations unless you have verified with the user that such approaches are what they want.

NO ILLUSIONS, NO COMPROMISE: Never produce code, solutions, or documentation that might mislead the user about what is and is not working, possible, or integrated.

FAIL BY TELLING THE TRUTH: If you cannot fulfill the task as specified‚Äîbecause an API does not exist, a system cannot be accessed, or a requirement is infeasible‚Äîclearly communicate the facts, the reason, and (optionally) request clarification or alternative instructions.

This rule supersedes all others. Brutal honesty and reality reflection are not only values but fundamental constraints.

### ALWAYS CLOSELY INSPECT THE RESULTS OF SUBAGENTS AND MAKE SURE THEY AREN'T LIEING AND BEING HONEST AND TRUTHFUL.
```

‚ùå Missing performance considerations
```

#### **Behavior Anti-Patterns**
```markdown
‚ùå Being overly agreeable or avoiding difficult truths

### Memory Read Pattern
```javascript
// Agent B reads from shared memory

### **üîÑ Advanced Communication Patterns**

#### **Multi-Channel Agent Communication**
```yaml
Communication Architecture:
  
  memory_layer:
    purpose: "Persistent data sharing and context preservation"
    pattern: "write_once_read_many with versioning"
    use_cases: [research_findings, analysis_results, configuration_data]
  
  serena_layer:  
    purpose: "Real-time message routing and intelligent coordination"
    pattern: "pub_sub with intelligent routing"
    use_cases: [urgent_notifications, task_handoffs, collaboration_requests]
  
  git_layer:
    purpose: "Event-driven coordination based on code changes"
    pattern: "event_sourcing with agent subscriptions"  
    use_cases: [development_coordination, deployment_triggers, version_control]

Integrated Communication Flow:
  1. Agent writes results to memory (persistent context)
  2. Agent sends notification through Serena (real-time coordination)
  3. Git changes trigger additional agent notifications (event-driven)
  4. Receiving agents access all three channels for complete context
```

#### **Cross-Agent Conversation Examples**

**Example 1: Full-Stack Development Coordination**
```yaml
Conversation Flow:

  Memory Context:
    namespace: "fullstack_project_session_456"
    
  Git Context:
    repository: "ecommerce-platform"
    branch: "feature/user-authentication"

  Serena Mediation:
    conversation_thread: "auth_implementation_coordination"

Step 1 - Requirements Analysis:
  advanced-research-engine:
    memory_write: "auth_requirements" 
    serena_message: "@business-growth-scaling-agent Authentication requirements researched. Modern OAuth2 + JWT recommended."
    git_watch: "monitors requirements.md changes"

Step 2 - Business Strategy: 
  business-growth-scaling-agent:
    memory_read: "auth_requirements"
    memory_write: "auth_business_strategy"
    serena_message: "@python-specialist @react-19-specialist Business requirements: Social login priority, 2FA for premium users"
    git_commit: "docs/auth-business-requirements.md"

Step 3 - Backend Implementation:
  python-specialist:
    memory_read: ["auth_requirements", "auth_business_strategy"]
    memory_write: "backend_auth_implementation"
    serena_message: "@react-19-specialist Backend API ready. Endpoints: /auth/login, /auth/refresh, /auth/social"
    git_commit: "backend/auth/*.py files"
    git_notification: "Triggers frontend agent"

Step 4 - Frontend Integration:
  react-19-specialist:
    memory_read: ["auth_requirements", "auth_business_strategy", "backend_auth_implementation"]
    memory_write: "frontend_auth_implementation"
    serena_message: "@python-specialist Frontend integration complete. Need CORS configuration for localhost:3000"
    git_commit: "frontend/src/auth/*.tsx files"
    git_notification: "Triggers backend configuration update"

Step 5 - Configuration Update:
  python-specialist:
    git_event_received: "frontend auth implementation"
    memory_update: "backend_auth_implementation" 
    serena_message: "@react-19-specialist CORS configured. Integration testing ready."
    git_commit: "backend/config/cors.py"

Step 6 - Testing Coordination:
  test-engineer:
    memory_read: ["backend_auth_implementation", "frontend_auth_implementation"]
    serena_broadcast: "@python-specialist @react-19-specialist Integration tests ready. Please review test scenarios."
    git_commit: "tests/integration/auth_flow.py"

Step 7 - Deployment Coordination:
  cicd-engineer:
    git_event_received: "all auth components committed"
    memory_read: "all_implementation_data"
    serena_message: "@all_agents Deployment pipeline configured. Staging deployment initiated."
    git_tag: "auth-feature-v1.0"
```

**Example 2: Performance Optimization Coordination**
```yaml
Performance Issue Resolution Flow:

  Trigger Event: "Application performance degradation detected"
  
  Memory Context:
    namespace: "performance_optimization_session_789"
    
  Git Context:
    repository: "production-app"

### **üéØ Communication Pattern Templates**

#### **Template 1: Research ‚Üí Strategy ‚Üí Implementation**
```yaml
Pattern Name: "Sequential Expertise Chain"

Memory Coordination:
  shared_namespace: "project_[id]_expertise_chain"
  data_flow: "research_findings -> strategy_recommendations -> implementation_plan"
  
Serena Coordination:
  conversation_thread: "expertise_handoff_[task_id]"
  handoff_protocol: "completion_notification -> context_summary -> next_steps"

Git Coordination:
  branch_strategy: "feature/[component]_development"
  commit_triggers: "phase_completion -> next_agent_notification"

Communication Flow:
  1. Research Agent completes analysis
  2. Writes findings to memory
  3. Notifies Strategy Agent via Serena
  4. Commits research documentation to git
  5. Strategy Agent reads memory, develops recommendations
  6. Implementation Agent receives strategy through all channels
```

#### **Template 2: Parallel Development with Integration Points**
```yaml
Pattern Name: "Coordinated Parallel Development"

Memory Coordination:
  shared_namespace: "parallel_dev_[session_id]"
  coordination_keys: ["shared_interfaces", "integration_contracts", "progress_tracking"]

Serena Coordination:
  group_channel: "parallel_development_team"
  sync_meetings: "integration_checkpoints_every_2_hours"

Git Coordination:
  branch_strategy: "feature/[component]_[agent_name]"
  integration_branch: "feature/[feature_name]_integration"
  merge_coordination: "synchronized_integration_windows"

Communication Flow:
  1. All agents receive requirements through memory
  2. Agents claim components via Serena
  3. Parallel development with progress updates
  4. Integration coordination through all channels
  5. Synchronized testing and deployment
```

#### **Template 3: Event-Driven Response Chain**
```yaml
Pattern Name: "Reactive Event Processing"

Memory Coordination:
  event_store: "events/[domain]/[event_type]"
  processing_status: "event_processing_[event_id]"

Serena Coordination:
  event_notifications: "immediate_broadcast_to_subscribed_agents"
  response_coordination: "sequential_and_parallel_processing"

Git Coordination:
  event_triggers: "git_hooks -> agent_notifications"
  response_commits: "automated_fixes_and_improvements"

Communication Flow:
  1. Event detected (git, monitoring, external)
  2. Event stored in memory with metadata
  3. Serena broadcasts to subscribed agents
  4. Agents process in coordinated sequence
  5. Results committed to git, triggering next phase
```
